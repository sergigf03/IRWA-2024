# Project Title

**LAB1: Data Analysis with Python**

## Description

This Jupyter notebook (`LAB1_U199880_U198725.ipynb`) contains code and analysis for a data science or programming task performed in Python. It demonstrates key steps in data analysis, including data manipulation, visualization, and a brief statistical analysis. The notebook uses Python libraries such as:

- **Pandas** for data manipulation.
- **NumPy** for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
- **Other libraries** relevant to the specific analysis.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab (or just use Google Collab)
- The following Python libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - Any additional libraries used in the notebook
- The  data files: a json file with the farmers protest tweets (farmers-protest-tweets.json) and a csv file with the mapping from the dcouments ids and the tweets ids (tweet_document_ids_map.csv)


## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Collab by navigating to the project folder
2. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Importing datasets and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data to identify patterns or trends.
3. **Data Modeling**: The output of the tweets and making a dictionary of dictionaries to map the documents to the tweets.
